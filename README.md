# Airbus-Ship-Detection-Challenge
My participation in Airbus Ship Detection Challenge proposed by Kaggle as part of the INF473V course: Deep Learning in Computer Vision.

### Goal of the project
The goal of this project is to detect ships from satellite images. The difficulty lies in the fact that the images present a lot of imperfections such as clouds and fog and that the boats are sometimes too small.
